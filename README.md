## Credit Card Approval Prediction
Abstract:
Credit cards are widely used for payments, but manually processing credit card applications is time-consuming and prone to errors. In this study, we analyze individual information and applicant data to predict the likelihood of future credit card defaults. We perform exploratory data analysis to understand the data and compare several supervised machine learning algorithms. We also identify the key features that determine whether a customer will be a "bad" client. Finally, we select the best-performing algorithm, which achieves approximately 90% - 95% accuracy in predicting credit card approvals.
