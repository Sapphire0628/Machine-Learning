## Credit Card Approval Prediction

Credit cards are widely used for payments, but manually processing credit card applications is time-consuming and prone to errors. In this study, we analyze individual information and applicant data to predict the likelihood of future credit card defaults. We perform exploratory data analysis to understand the data and compare several supervised machine learning algorithms. We also identify the key features that determine whether a customer will be a "bad" client. Finally, we select the best-performing algorithm, which achieves approximately 90% - 95% accuracy in predicting credit card approvals.

## Strokes Prediction
This project analyzes and predicts strokes using various factors such as age, marital status, heart disease, average glucose level, and hypertension. The data is preprocessed to ensure quality, and classification models are evaluated. The decision tree model shows superior performance in predicting strokes. The study highlights the correlation between stroke and factors like age and BMI. Recommendations are provided for stroke prevention, including dietary changes and lifestyle modifications. This project contributes to understanding stroke risk and promoting healthier lifestyles. [links](https://github.com/Sapphire0628/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/main/Strokes%20Prediction/README.md)

## Steel Plates Faults Detection

This study focuses on the task of predicting the type of faults in steel plates using classification models. The dataset consists of 1941 observations with 27 features and 7 class labels. Data preprocessing steps, including data separation, missing value handling, data splitting, normalization, and oversampling, were performed to prepare the dataset.

Four classification models (K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) were trained on the dataset, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied for dimensionality reduction. The models were evaluated with and without PCA.

These findings indicate the effectiveness of classification models for fault detection in steel plates, with Random Forest being the most promising approach. The study's outcomes have implications for enhancing safety measures in steel structures.
